# My own .dotfiles

My own setup for a proper webdev environment from a fresh osx install.  
Slightly inspired by https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles

### Overview

- Homebrew based
- Docker
- Node.js / python
- VScode
- iTerm
- Shell: zsh / prezto
- Ayu theme & Source code pro font

### Getting started

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/ebourmalo/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
./setup.sh
```

From there, everything will be installed automagically ;)
